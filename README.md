# Essentials of Cyber Security

Cyber Security is an *awesome* field! It is also **daunting**. You go to google and search *How do I get a career in cyber security?* and it is easy to become overwhelmed.
A simple search on YouTube lended me the following results: *How YOU can become a Cyber Security in 1 Month (Not Clickbait)* and *Learn Cyber Security NOW!* and the video is a
link to a self promoted and overpriced course. AND THEN THERE'S ALL THOSE DARN CERTIFICATIONS! Which one should I get? Are they even worth it? And so on. Cyber Security is a confusing 
field!

This resource is here to guide you and provide you with free, no strings attached, videos, labs, and reading materials on cyber security.

## Where to begin?

The question now is *Where do I even begin?* and the answer might be a little dissapointing for some. You begin **not** with cyber security (\*Gasp!\*), but instead with the
basics. You're going to need to know how to program and the basics of computer networking. Why? Well, we are making you cyber security professionals! We don't want you to be
a script kiddy. We want you to understand what's going on and what the computer is doing! And to understand what the computer is doing, you need to be able to speak their language, which happens
to be a programming language. As to why you need to understand computer networking -- the answers simple when you think about it. What is Cyber Security? It is defending and attacking networks, kind of. This is
a simplification and there exists many more niches within cyber security (digital forensics, incident response, policy, etc.), but those two truths remain at the center of it.

### I have to learn ALL of that before I begin?
So I need to know computer networking **and** programming before I even begin? Well, not really. It is important and it is imperative that you learn them. But if you get caught up in learning X before Y, you'll
never learn Y. So learn those adjacent to the course! It's preferred that you know them, but it's not going to be the end all be all. I don't want to understate their importance
becuase they are very important and if you want to break into the field, you're going to need to understand them.

So, the purpose of this guide is to help guide you and I've begun with leaving you two giant problems. I won't leave you stranded. If you search programming and computer networking, you'll
be overwhelmed by the options. There are tons of resources, but not all resources are created equal. 

## Which Programming Language Do I Choose? And which couurse?? Aghhh!

### Python
As for which programming language, a slightly misguided answer might be *It doesn't matter. Choose whichever language you want!* This is true, but you need the right level of abstractions
to work with. As such, Python fulfills this role great! Here is my recommended courses for Python:

* INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE AND PROGRAMMING IN PYTHON by MIT OCW found <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/pages/syllabus/"> here </a>
    * Finishing this course will give you a great foundation! There is also an edX equivalent with shorter videos if that's more your style.
* Corey Schafer's YouTube account found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Coreyms"> here </a>
    * This is great, but it won't give you the full picture. You'll have many gaps if this is your sole source.
* Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes found <a href="https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e"> here </a>
    * If books are more your style, than this here is a great resource
    * I find it better than a lot of other books because I find it more complete than others, and it has tons of amazing hand-on learning

### JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is another awesome first language! It's also essential to cyber security because JS rules the web. If you're going to be defedning the web, you're going to need to understand
the web! And JS is a must for that!

Unfortunately, the list of free amazing JavaScript courses is not as good Python's, but there's still some great ones!
* Eloquent JavaScript
